-- This file contains a low-level code for parsing a Spad source file 
-- into an internal AST.  Please note that this AST is the AST used by
-- the Spad compiler, which is different from the AST used by the 
-- interpreter (a VAT). The AST, for the entire file, is a List Syntax
-- Since this is low-level code, I don't expect people to get here,
-- and you should directly use it.  If you think, you need to get to
-- here, then something is already wrong.
-- There is a higher-level interface, written in SPAD, to this
-- code.  See the algebra file spad-parser.spad.
