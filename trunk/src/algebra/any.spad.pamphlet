++ Also See: None
++ AMS Classification:
++ Keywords:
++ Description:
++   \spadtype{Any} implements a type that packages up objects and their
++   types in objects of \spadtype{Any}. Roughly speaking that means
++   that if \spad{s : S} then when converted to \spadtype{Any}, the new
++   object will include both the original object and its type. This is
++   a way of converting arbitrary objects into a single type without
++   losing any of the original information. Any object can be converted
++   to one of \spadtype{Any}.

Any(): SetCategory with
        any             : (SExpression, None) -> %
          ++ any(type,object) is a technical function for creating
          ++ an object of \spadtype{Any}. Arugment \spad{type} is a \spadgloss{LISP} form
          ++ for the type of \spad{object}.
        domainOf        : % -> OutputForm
          ++ domainOf(a) returns a printable form of the type of the
          ++ original object that was converted to \spadtype{Any}.
        objectOf        : % -> OutputForm
          ++ objectOf(a) returns a printable form of the
          ++ original object that was converted to \spadtype{Any}.
        dom             : % -> SExpression
          ++ dom(a) returns a \spadgloss{LISP} form of the type of the
          ++ original object that was converted to \spadtype{Any}.
        obj             : % -> None
          ++ obj(a) essentially returns the original object that was
          ++ converted to \spadtype{Any} except that the type is forced
          ++ to be \spadtype{None}.
        showTypeInOutput: Boolean -> String
          ++ showTypeInOutput(bool) affects the way objects of
          ++ \spadtype{Any} are displayed. If \spad{bool} is true
          ++ then the type of the original object that was converted
          ++ to \spadtype{Any} will be printed. If \spad{bool} is
          ++ false, it will not be printed.

++ Description:
++   \spadtype{AnyFunctions1} implements several utility functions for

AnyFunctions1(S:Type): with

          ++ retractIfCan(a) tries change \spad{a} into an object
          ++ of type \spad{S}. If it can, then such an object is
          ++ returned. Otherwise, "failed" is returned.
        retractable?: Any -> Boolean
          ++ retractable?(a) tests if \spad{a} can be converted
          ++ into an object of type \spad{S}.
        retract     : Any -> S
          ++ retract(a) tries to convert \spad{a} into an object of
          ++ type \spad{S}. If possible, it returns the object.
