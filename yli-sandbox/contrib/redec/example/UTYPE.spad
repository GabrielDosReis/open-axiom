++ Description: The category of domains that act like unions.
++ UnionType, like Type or Category, acts mostly as a take that
++ communicates `union-like' intended semantics to the compiler.
++ A domain D that satifies UnionType should provide definitions
++ for `case' operators, with corresponding `autoCoerce' operators.
