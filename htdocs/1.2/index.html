  <h2 name="base">1. Base Reference Document</h2>

  <p>
  OpenAxiom is a descendent of the AXIOM computer algebra system
  as described by Richard Jenks and Robert Sutor in
  <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=131846&dl=">AXIOM: The
  Scientific Computation System.</a>  That book is the base reference
  document for OpenAxiom.
  </p>

  <h2 name="changes">2. Changes From The Base Document</h2>

  <h3 name="1.2.0-changes">2.1. OpenAxiom-1.2.0</h3>

  This release introduces the following changes from the base document
  <h4 name="1.2.0-changes-int">2.1.1 Interpreter</h4>

    <ul>

      <li>
         The interpreter now evaluates the <code>typeOf</code> of a
         category as <code>Category</code>, when it previously reported
         <code>SubDomain Domain</code> which wasn't any real domain
         or category.  The interpreter also evaluates
         <code>typeOf Domain</code> and <code>typeOf Category</code>
         as <code>Type</code>, an existing category.  As a consequence,
         we have that <code>Type</code> conceptually has type
         <code>Type</code>.      
      </li>

     <li>
       The deprecated system command <code>)with</code> was removed.
     </li>

     <li>
       Support for the unofficial, undocumented, operator
       <code>^=</code> (for <em>not equal</em>) has been discontinued.
       It was not documented in the Axiom Book, and was redundant with
       the documented notation <code>~=</code>.  This change affects
       both interpreted and compiled codes.
     </li>

     <li>
        The interpreter now allows <code>f(x +-> 2*x,y)</code> without
        extra parenthesis around the anonymous function, where the 
        function f is a function accepting a function as the first
        argument.  This change was contributed by Juergen Weiss.
     </li>

     <li>
        The interpreter now accepts instantiation of a domain or
        category constructor with a homogeneous variable length
        argument list, when the constructor is declared to accept a Tuple.
     </li>

     <li>It is now possible to restrict the type of a mapping-valued
         expression, e.g.
         <pre>
              _*$Float@((NonNegativeInteger,Float) -> Float)
         </pre>
         now selects the multiplication operation default supplied
         by the category <code>AbelianGroup</code> instead of 
         producing an error.
     </li>

    </ul>

  <h4 name="1.2.0-changes-comp">2.1.2. Compiler</h4>
    <ul>
       <li>The compiler now accepts constant declarations in a more
           direct style.  For example, the following code is now accepted
           <pre>
             MyUnit(T: Type): Public == Private where
               Public ==> with
                  1: T
               Private ==> add
                  1 == 0$T
           </pre>
           Until OpenAxiom-1.2.0, the declaration for <code>1</code> should
           have been written
           <pre>
              1: constant -> T
           </pre>
       </li>

       <li>Iterator variables and variables declared in a loop, or a reduction,
           or a collectt, are local to that loop.  This change should not
           affect well written Spad codes.
       </li>

       <li>The Spad compiler used to accept constructs like
           <code>&prime;e</code> where <code>e</code> is any s-expression
           as a way to inject a value in any datatype without 
           type checking.  That capability is discontinued and the
           quoting is now accepted only for literal symbols.
       </li>
    </ul>

  <h4 name="1.2.0-changes-alg">2.1.3. Algebra</h4>
 
  The following types have been added to OpenAxiom-1.2.0
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>MathML</code>:  This package has been contributed
      by Arthur Ralfs and Alfredo Portes. 
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>System</code>:  This package provides access to some
        runtime characteristics of the running OpenAxiom system.  This
        package has been contributed by Gabriel Dos Reis.
    </li>

    <li><code>Signature</code>: This domain is the datatype for 
       operation signatures as used by the interpreter and compilr.
    </li>

    <li>The category <code>SetAggregate</code> used to export an operation
        for computing multiset-inclusion under the name of <code>&lt;</code>.
        The name of that operation is now <code>part?</code>.  The less-than
        operator is consistently reserved for the category 
        <code>OrderedSet</code>.
    </li>

  </ul>
  
  <h3 name="1.2.0-changes-rt">2.2.  Runtime System </h3>
   
  Starting from OpenAxiom-1.2.0, new Lisp systems are supported:
  SBCL, and CLisp.  This means that if GCL is not supported on
  your machine, but either of SBCL or CLisp is installed, then you
  can run OpenAxiom.  OpenAxiom's <code>configure</code> script
  will automatically detected that if you're building from source
  code.
