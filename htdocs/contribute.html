  <h2>Contributing to OpenAxiom</h2>

  <p>
  The OpenAxiom developers highly encourage individuals (researchers,
  teachers, students, etc) as well as organizations to contribute
  to the development of OpenAxiom, in form of new algorithms, libraries,
  new features, bug fixes, documentations, web page improvements, etc.
  </p>

  <h3>Legal Prerequisites</h3>

  <p>
  OpenAxiom is an open source software under a BSD-type license described
  <a href="license.html">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Submitting Patches</h3>

  <p>
  Every patch must have several pieces of information, <em>before</em>
  it can be properly evaluated:
  </p>

   <dl class="description">
     <dt>A description of the problem/bug and how your patch addresses it.</dt>

     <dd>
       For new features a description of the feature and your
       implementation. For bugs a description of what was wrong with the
       existing code, and a reference to any previous bug report and any
       existing testcases for the problem in the OpenAxiom testsuite.
     </dd>


     <dt>Testcases.</dt>

     <dd>
       If you cannot include testcases, you should include a justification for
       why adequate testcases cannot be added.
     </dd>

      <dt>ChangeLog.</dt>

      <dd>
	A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files for
	format and content, GNU Coding
	Standards for further information. The ChangeLog entries should be
	plaintext rather than part of the patch since the top of the ChangeLog
	changes rapidly and a patch to the ChangeLog would probably no longer
	apply by the time your patch is reviewed. 
      </dd>

      <dt>Bootstrapping and testing.</dt>
      <dd>
	State the host and target combinations you used to do proper testing,
	and the results of your testing. 
      </dd>

      <dt>The Patch Itself.</dt>
      <dd>
	If you are accessing the 
	<a href="download.html">SVN repository</a>
	at SF.net, please configure
	your svn to use GNU diff and generate patches using the "-p" or "-up"
	options. See SVN setup instructions for more details. If your version
	of diff does not support these options, then get the latest version of
	GNU diff. Patches against current development (SVN trunk) are preferred
	to patches against releases, unless your patch is intended as a
	candidate for the release branch.
       </dd>
   </dl>

   <p>
   Don't mix together changes made for different reasons. Send them
   individually. Ideally, each change you send should be impossible to
   subdivide into parts that we might want to consider separately, because each
   of its parts gets its motivation from the other parts. In particular,
   changes to code formatting to conform to coding standards are best not mixed
   with substantive changes, because that makes it difficult to see what the
   real changes are. (In the case of a very large reorganization of code, it
   may make sense to separate changes even further to make it clearer what has
   changed; for example, by first sending structural changes that make
   subsequent changes easier but do not change OpenAxiom's behavior, then 
   new code,  then the changes that actually make use of the new code and 
   change OpenAxiom's behavior.)
   </p>

   <p>
   When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail message and 
   send it to <a href="lists.html">open-axiom-patches@lists.sf.net</a>.
