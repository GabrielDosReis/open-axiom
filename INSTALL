---------------------------
-- Configuring OpenAxiom --
---------------------------

Type:
	./configure

----------------------
-- Making OpenAxiom --
----------------------

Type:
	make

--------------------------
-- Installing OpenAxiom --
--------------------------

Type:
	make install

==

The above chain of commands should build OpenAxiom and install an
executable script called 'axiom' in  /usr/local/bin.  You can
configure OpenAxiom as

   ./configure --prefix=/banana/space

to have the script 'axiom' installed in /banana/space/bin.


About Make
==========

OpenAxiom build system requires GNU Make.  It migth theoretically be
possible to cram the Makefiles so that they can work with a large set 
of Make programs.  However, doing so will not be cost effective.  GNU 
Make has been ported to virtually any system current OpenAxiom can build
one.  In particular, OpenAxiom uses GCL, which in turns requires GCC.
GCC requires GNU Make.  GCL too requires GNU Make.  Consequently,
the GNU Make requirement is not a stringent requirement.  It just
reflects reality.

So, if you're using a system where "make" is not GNU Make, then try
"gmake" instead.
