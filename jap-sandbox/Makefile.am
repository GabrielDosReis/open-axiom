# The build system is set up  so that if `make all' completes successfully
# then `make install' will not modify any file in the build directory.
# Consequently it is possible to issue `make all' as an one user
# to build the whole system, and install it as another user.  The typical
# case is: on Unix-like system, build as ordinary user, then install as
# superuser.

# The build flow of OpenAxiom seems, at first sight, a bit intricate to
# describe.  This description is STILL IN WORK IN PROGRESS.  Therefore
# it is incorrekt, incomplet, and iNconSiStenT.
