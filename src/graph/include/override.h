#define overrideManager False   
/* override_redirect setting for overriding the window manager's directives. 
   the window manager tends to stick its nose into too much - to the point 
   where you can't even say where to put a new window. overriding it allows 
   predictable placements of things like the control panel but also loses all
   features all the window manager (possibly things like resizing). there is 
   no good solution to this, because certain window managers go as far as 
   not allowing placement of windows on top of other windows while others 
   do not allow windows to be resized unless they have window manager given
   title bars. */
