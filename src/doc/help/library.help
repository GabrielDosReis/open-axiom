==============================================================================
A.14.  )library
==============================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )library libName1  [libName2 ...]
  - )library )dir dirName
  - )library )only objName1  [objlib2 ...]
  - )library )noexpose
 
Command Description: 
 
This command replaces the )load system command that was available in OpenAxiom
releases before version 2.0. The )library command makes available to OpenAxiom
the compiled objects in the libraries listed.
 
For example, if you )compile dopler.as in your home directory, issue )library
dopler to have OpenAxiom look at the library, determine the category and domain
constructors present, update the internal database with various properties of
the constructors, and arrange for the constructors to be automatically loaded
when needed. If the )noexpose option has not been given, the constructors
will be exposed (that is, available) in the current frame.
 
If you compiled a file with the old system compiler, you will have an NRLIB
present, for example, DOPLER.NRLIB, where DOPLER is a constructor
abbreviation. The command )library DOPLER will then do the analysis and
database updates as above.
 
To tell the system about all libraries in a directory, use )library )dir
dirName where dirName is an explicit directory. You may specify ``.'' as the
directory, which means the current directory from which you started the
system or the one you set via the )cd command. The directory name is required.
 
You may only want to tell the system about particular constructors within a
library. In this case, use the )only option. The command )library dopler
)only Test1 will only cause the Test1 constructor to be analyzed, autoloaded,
etc..
 
Finally, each constructor in a library are usually automatically exposed when
the )library command is used. Use the )noexpose option if you not want them
exposed. At a later time you can use )set expose add constructor to expose
any hidden constructors.
 
Note for OpenAxiom beta testers: At various times this command was
called )local and )with before the name )library became the official name.
