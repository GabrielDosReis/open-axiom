\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This pamphlet defines the base initial environment for building
  a Boot translator image.  It essentially etablishes a namespace
  (package \Code{Boot}) for the Boot translator, and defines 
  some macros that need to be present during translation of Boot
  source files.

\section{The \code{BOOTTRAN} package}

All Boot translator functions are defined in the package
\code{BOOTTRAN}.  It is expected that the translator interfaces
with the rest of the system only through the functions explicitly exported
by \code{BOOTTRAN}:
<<boot-translator>>=
(defpackage "BOOTTRAN"
  (:use "AxiomCore")
  #+:common-lisp  (:use "COMMON-LISP")
  #-:common-lisp  (:use "LISP"))

@

\section{I/O macros}

The Boot translator source codes make uses of some 
higher order functions.  For various reasons, including efficiency,
they are defined as Lisp macros and must therefore be available in each
source file that uses them.

\subsection{[[shoeInputFile]]}

<<with-input-file>>=
(defmacro |shoeOpenInputFile|
     (stream fn prog)
    `(with-open-file (,stream ,fn :direction :input
       :if-does-not-exist nil) ,prog))
@

This macro creates a input stream object from a file name [[fn]], and 
processes it with [[prog]].  If the file name designates a non-existent 
file, the standard input is used instead.

\subsection{[[shoeOpenOutputFile]]}
<<with-output-file>>=
(defmacro |shoeOpenOutputFile|
     (stream fn prog)
    `(with-open-file (,stream ,fn :direction :output
       :if-exists :supersede) ,prog))
@

This macro creates an output stream object from a file name [[fn]], and 
processes it with [[prog]].  The output file is overwritten if it exists.
