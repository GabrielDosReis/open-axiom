  -  )display properties all
  -  )display properties [obj1 [obj2 ...]]
  -  )display value all
  -  )display value [obj1 [obj2 ...]]

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to display the contents of the workspace and signatures
of functions with a given name. (A signature gives the argument and return
types of a function.) 
 
The command
 
)display names
 
lists the names of all user-defined objects in the workspace. This is useful
if you do not wish to see everything about the objects and need only be
reminded of their names.
 
The commands
 
)display all
)display properties
)display properties all
 
all do the same thing: show the values and types and declared modes of all
variables in the workspace. If you have defined functions, their signatures
and definitions will also be displayed.
 
To show all information about a particular variable or user functions, for
example, something named d, issue
 
)display properties d
 
To just show the value (and the type) of d, issue
 
)display value d
 
To just show the declared mode of d, issue
 
)display mode d
 
All modemaps for a given operation may be displayed by using )display
operations. A modemap is a collection of information about a particular
reference to an operation. This includes the types of the arguments and the
return value, the location of the implementation and any conditions on the
types. The modemap may contain patterns. The following displays the modemaps
for the operation FromcomplexComplexCategory:
