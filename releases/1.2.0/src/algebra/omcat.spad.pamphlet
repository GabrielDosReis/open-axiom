++ \spadtype{OpenMath} provides operations for exporting an object
++ in OpenMath format.

OpenMath(): Category == with
  OMwrite  : % -> String
  ++ OMwrite(u) returns the OpenMath XML encoding of \axiom{u} as a
  ++ complete OpenMath object.
  OMwrite  : (%, Boolean) -> String
  ++ OMwrite(u, true) returns the OpenMath XML encoding of \axiom{u}
  ++ as a complete OpenMath object; OMwrite(u, false) returns the
  ++ OpenMath XML encoding of \axiom{u} as an OpenMath fragment.
  OMwrite  : (OpenMathDevice, %) -> Void
  ++ OMwrite(dev, u) writes the OpenMath form of \axiom{u} to the
  ++ OpenMath device \axiom{dev} as a complete OpenMath object.
  OMwrite  : (OpenMathDevice, %, Boolean) -> Void
  ++ OMwrite(dev, u, true) writes the OpenMath form of \axiom{u} to
  ++ the OpenMath device \axiom{dev} as a complete OpenMath object;
  ++ OMwrite(dev, u, false) writes the object as an OpenMath fragment.
