MatrixOpSym(R:Field) : MOD  == Definition where
   Mat ==> Matrix R

   MOD ==>  with

      symmetricPart : Mat -> Mat
        ++ \spad{symmetricPart(m)} returns the symmetric part of m

   Definition ==>  add

      symmetricPart(m:Mat) : Mat ==
        m1:=transpose m
        import from Integer
        import from R
        inv(2::R) *(m+m1)
