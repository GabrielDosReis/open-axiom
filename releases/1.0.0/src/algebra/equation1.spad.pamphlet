++ Description:
++   This category provides \spadfun{eval} operations.
++   A domain may belong to this category if it is possible to make
++   ``evaluation'' substitutions.  The difference between this
++   and \spadtype{Evalable} is that the operations in this category
++   specify the substitution as a pair of arguments rather than as
++   an equation.
