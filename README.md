This is OpenAxiom, the open scientific computation system.

OpenAxiom is a BSD-licensed free software for symbolic and algebraic
computations. It offers an interactive environment, including  an
expressive programming language, a compiler, a large set of libraries
(algebras) of interest to researchers and practitioners of computational
sciences.  It is based on the original AXIOM system open sourced by
NAG in 2002, which was previsouly developed at the IBM TJ Watson
Research center.  

OpenAxiom strives to support ubiquitous, advanced, high quality
open source computer algebra on major operating systems, in particular
major Unix  variants, GNU/Linux variants, Windows, and handheld
devices.  It aims at being the open source computer algebra system of
choice for research, teaching, engineering, etc.  OpenAxiom leverages
existing mathematical software, in particular it provides interface to
mainstream programming languages (at the moment C and C++). 


For information about building, installing, and using OpenAxiom, please refer
to the file INSTALL.  We would like to hear from you: share your
experience with us at open-axiom-help@lists.sf.net.
