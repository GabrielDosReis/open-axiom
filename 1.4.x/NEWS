* February 14, 2008
  OpenAxiom-1.1.0 has been released.
  Changes from previous release:
  
  × OpenAxiom now supports batch processing, either for scripting
    or for compiling Spad libraries.

  × Many bugs fixes in both algebra and interpreter/compiler components.

  × The interpreter now allows `case' functions defined in libraries.
    Consequently, `case' no longer requires values of Union types, as
    long as the arguments are of appropriate types, e.g. ones for
    which a `case' operator has been defined.

  × OpenAxiom developers: depsys is no longer built.  All files in
    src/interp/ are now compiled with bootsys.

  × OpenAxiom has a new abstract syntax tree domain for representing Spad
    libraries, Spad scripts, and Boot programs.
    Furthermore, parsers for Spad libraries and Spad scripts are
    now part of the standard algebra.

  × OpenAxiom now supports aggregates/collections of domains.  More
    generally, it is now possible define and call functions with arguments
    that are of domain type.

  × OpenAxiom no longer uses global setting of the environment
    variable AXIOM.  Now, OpenAxiom's AXIOMsys can be invoked with
    optional command line argument specifying the system root
    directory and the system alegbra directory.

  × OpenAxiom now supports versioning, meaning that installing newer
    versions will not overwrite previous OpenAxiom version runtimes.

  × Build with the dependency tarball open-axiom-1.0.x-dep.tar.bz2 has
    been improved.  Many problems fixed.
