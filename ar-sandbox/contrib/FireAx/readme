FireAx is a beginning interface for OpenAxiom as a Firefox XUL extension.
I haven't packaged it for addon installation yet.

To try it out place a file called FireAx@mathbrane.ca in your Firefox 
extensions directory with the single line

/absolute/path/to/FireAx/FireAx-0.1.0/

Start panserver in OpenAxiom and then restart Firefox so it registers the
new extension.  FireAx will appear under the Firefox tools menu but I find
I get more agreeable behaviour if I start it by typing

chrome://fireax/content/FireAx.xul

into the URL box which then opens FireAx in the current tab.
