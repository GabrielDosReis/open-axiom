These files enable Martin Baker's Scenegraph graphics framework for
OpenAxiom.  Compile everything by executing

)read scene.input

assuming OpenAxiom is started from this directory.  The exampleN.input
files run the examples from Martin's website

http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/standards/program/mycode/graph/examples/index.htm

and the file test.input runs the code from here

http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/standards/program/mycode/graph/tutorial/index.htm

The examples all work except for example32.input which fails at the writeSvg
command.  I also found that I needed to execute a ")clear all" between some of
the examples so I included this at the start of each input file.

Martin updated panAxia's QuadraticForm and CliffordAlgebra domains.  I still
have to include the pamphlet files clifford.spad.pamphlet and
scene.spad.pamphlet which have Martin's documentation.
