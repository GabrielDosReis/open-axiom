++ Description:
++   This package provides functions complexZeros
++ for finding the complex zeros
++ of univariate polynomials with complex rational number coefficients.
++ The results are to any user specified precision and are returned
++ as either complex rational number or complex floating point numbers
++ depending on the type of the second argument which specifies the
++ precision.

-- Packages for the computation of complex roots of
-- univariate polynomials with rational or gaussian coefficients.

-- Simplified version, the old original based on Gebauer's solver is
-- in ocmplxrt spad

          ++ depending on the type of eps.
